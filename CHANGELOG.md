# Changelog

This repository uses a **governance-first change record**.

The authoritative, audit-ready history of changes is maintained here:

👉 **[docs/change-control-log.md](docs/change-control-log.md)**

That log records:
- schema evolution
- governance model changes
- validation and tooling updates
- rationale for decisions
- effective dates for each version

---

## Notes

- This file is intentionally lightweight to avoid duplication or drift.
- All regulated or audit-relevant change history lives in the change control log.
- Version numbers referenced elsewhere in the repository map directly to entries in  
  **[docs/change-control-log.md](docs/change-control-log.md)**.
