# Changelog

This repository uses a **governance-first change record**.

The authoritative, audit-ready history of changes is maintained here:

👉 **[docs/change-control-log.md](docs/change-control-log.md)**

That log records:
- schema evolution
- governance model changes
- validation and tooling updates
- rationale for decisions
- effective dates for each version

- ## v1.4.0
- Added canonical example demonstrating bounded AI-assisted conditional_go
  with explicit disclosure and preserved human authority
  (`rgds-dec-0006-ai-assisted-conditional-go.json`).

---

## Notes

- This file is intentionally lightweight to avoid duplication or drift.
- All regulated or audit-relevant change history lives in the change control log.
- Version numbers referenced elsewhere in the repository map directly to entries in  
  **[docs/change-control-log.md](docs/change-control-log.md)**.
