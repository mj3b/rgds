# RGDS Documentation

This folder contains governance, policy, and supporting artifacts
for Regulated Gate Decision Support (RGDS).

Not all documents here carry equal authority.

---

## Authoritative artifacts

These define how decisions are made, governed, and audited:

- `decision-log.md`
- `governance.md`
- `role-decision-artifact-matrix.md`
- `ai-assistance-policy.md`

---

## Supporting artifacts

These support decision preparation and review,
but do **not** carry decision authority:

- `ai-checks/`
- `change-control-log.md`
- `why-rgds-exists.md`

Supporting artifacts must always roll up into the Decision Log.

---

## Reviewer guidance

If you are reviewing a decision:
1. Start with the **Decision Log**
2. Use supporting artifacts to understand context
3. Confirm governance completeness
4. Record disposition explicitly

RGDS prioritizes **clarity over volume**.
