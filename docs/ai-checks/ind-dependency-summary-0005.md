# AI Dependency Summary — RGDS-DEC-0005

Purpose: Provide a concise, human-reviewable summary of rate-limiting dependencies for the IND Readiness Gate.
Note: Informational only; the Program Manager and Submission Manager own the integrated plan.

## Rate-limiting dependencies

1. Final signed GLP tox report
- Current: audited draft used for drafting
- Expected: 2026-02-10
- Why it matters: may require propagation across Module 2.6, IB, and protocol dosing narrative

2. Additional stability timepoints (3M/6M)
- Current: in progress
- Expected: 2026-03-01
- Why it matters: supports shelf-life and storage claims; may require updates in Module 3 and cross-referenced text

3. Publishing lock points
- Lock 1: 2026-01-18 (protocol + IB/GIP narrative freeze)
- Lock 2: 2026-01-19 (eCTD assembly begins; only critical fixes with QA approval)
- Why it matters: constrains what can change late and requires controlled routing for any late-breaking inserts

## Triage triggers
- Any tox delta affecting NOAEL or dosing margin → immediate re-review by Regulatory + Nonclinical + Clinical
- Any stability change affecting shelf-life qualifiers → CMC + QA sign-off required
- Any post-lock edits → Submission Manager approval + propagation checklist entry required
