# AI Consistency Check — RGDS-DEC-0005

Purpose: Provide a human-reviewable checklist of potential inconsistencies across IND submission artifacts.
Scope: Module 2.6 (nonclinical summaries), IB, and Protocol (Module 5).
Note: This artifact is informational only. It does not recommend a decision and must be reviewed by required reviewers.

## Checklist

### Dosing and safety margins
- [ ] NOAEL value and units consistent across Module 2.6 tox summary, IB, and protocol rationale
- [ ] Human equivalent dose (HED) calculation references consistent assumptions
- [ ] Starting dose and escalation rules match across protocol text and synopsis tables
- [ ] Safety factor language is consistent (no conflicting qualifiers)

### Stability / shelf-life qualifiers
- [ ] Shelf-life statements are consistently qualified given available timepoints (e.g., “supported through 1-month data”)
- [ ] Storage conditions and handling instructions match across Module 3 references in IB and protocol
- [ ] Any “rolling update” language is consistent and does not imply finalized timepoints

### Terminology and nomenclature
- [ ] Test article name, code, salt form, and formulation naming consistent across documents
- [ ] Units and concentration formatting consistent (mg/kg, mg/mL, etc.)
- [ ] Study identifiers (tox study IDs, batch IDs) match across references
