# RGDS AI Checks

This folder contains **informational, non-authoritative artifacts**
designed to support human review under compressed timelines.

AI checks in RGDS:
- do not recommend decisions
- do not accept or reject risk
- do not override human judgment
- do not function autonomously

They exist to surface **potential inconsistencies, gaps, and dependencies**
so humans can decide deliberately.

---

## How to use these artifacts

AI checks may be:
- populated manually
- partially drafted using AI assistance

All outputs **must be reviewed by humans**.
Reviewer disposition must be recorded.

Unreviewed AI outputs are not valid governance inputs.

## Relationship to RGDS governance

AI checks complement—but do not replace—the Decision Log.

If an AI check identifies material issues, the outcome must be reflected in:
- decision rationale
- evidence completeness
- risk posture
- conditions or deferral decisions

---

## Included checks

- **AI Consistency Check**  
  Cross-document alignment (dosing, safety, terminology)

- **AI Dependency Summary**  
  Snapshot of rate-limiting dependencies

- **AI Evidence Completeness Check**  
  Explicit acknowledgment of evidence states and gaps

- **AI Regulatory Interaction Consistency Check**  
  Interpretation integrity for regulatory feedback

---

## Design principle

AI checks exist to improve **decision quality**, not decision speed.
