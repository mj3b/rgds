# RGDS — Regulated Gate Decision Support


## Canonical Reference Decisions

If you read only one thing in this repository, read:

- `examples/rgds-dec-0001.json` — **CANONICAL conditional_go** (GO with explicit, owned conditions)
- `examples/rgds-dec-0002-no-go.json` — **CANONICAL no_go** (No-Go with defensible rationale and re-entry path)

These examples demonstrate the intended RGDS operating model: human-governed, evidence-linked, schema-validated, and explicitly non-agentic.
