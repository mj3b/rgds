# RGDS Evaluation Note (Draft)

This note defines evaluation artifacts for a regulated, human-governed decision-support system.

## Measures
- Task-level accuracy (extraction/comparison fidelity)
- Missed-risk rate (false negatives)
- Human override rate (accepted/edited/rejected)
- Time-to-decision delta
- Decision confidence delta (structured reviewer scoring)

## Principle
AI-assisted outputs are not treated as evidence by default; they are drafting aids unless explicitly validated and approved.
