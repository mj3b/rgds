- `rgds-dec-0002-no-go.json` — **No-go** demonstrating defensible stopping criteria and remediation actions before re-review.
- `rgds-dec-0003-defer-required-evidence.json` — **Defer with required evidence** demonstrating explicit missing evidence and re-entry logic.
- `rgds-dec-0004-regulatory-interaction.json` — **Regulatory interaction** decision record (baseline pattern).
- `rgds-dec-0005-conditional-go-author-at-risk.json` — **Kasturi pattern:** drafting with placeholders (**author-at-risk**) + **review triage routing** + **scope change event** + fallback.
