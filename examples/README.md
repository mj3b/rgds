# Examples

These are illustrative RGDS decision records intended to show how the Decision Log schema is used in practice.

## Canonical examples (start here)

- `rgds-dec-0001.json` — **Canonical conditional_go**: go with explicit, owned conditions; governance approvals; bounded AI assistance disclosure.
- `rgds-dec-0002-no-go.json` — **Canonical no_go**: defensible refusal with rationale, risks, and a re-entry path.
- `rgds-dec-0005-ind-conditional-go-author-at-risk.json` — **Canonical IND-style conditional_go**: author-at-risk items, reviewer triage, and publishing lock points (IND readiness gate).

## Additional patterns

- `rgds-dec-0003-defer-required-evidence.json` — Defer-with-required-evidence: defines what evidence must exist before re-review.
- `rgds-dec-0004-regulatory-interaction.json` — Regulatory interaction decision: pre-IND strategy framing, questions, and governance.
